or THE Bssmssrrrs or A HART'S TESTICLES; or A rox’s muns. 9

Against a snake's bite hartshorn has also power to
dry up every wet; hence it is used as an eye-salve. Against
headache, drink the weight of five pennies of ashes of
hartshorn with one sextarius of wine and two of water3
take a cup full of this every day and drink. This drink 5
also restrains sore of womb. Against wagging of teeth,
hartshorn burnt and pounded steadies the teeth, if one
wisely uses it. Ad mulieris fluxum hartshorn beaten to
dust and drunk in wine: she shall soon be well. Against
worms, to kill [them], drink burnt hartshorn in hot water: 10
it kills and casts out the worms. Also to kill snakes take
ashes of the horn and spread them where they (the snakes)
are: they shall soon ssee away. Against sore of milt take
burnt hartshorn in a sweet drink: it shall dry up the milt
and remove away the sore. Against tetter, mingle burnt 15
hartshorn with vinegar, smear with that; amendment soon
comes to it. Again, to get a tetter off the face, mingle
with oil burnt hartshorn and smear3 when that is dried,
renew it again. Do this before the rising of the sun:
quickly it cures. Ut coitus appetitus excitetur, sume cervi 20
testiculos et siccatos in pulverem redige, partemque in vini
poculum indito: ita coitus appetitus excitatur. For the
same take a hart’s dung and pound it to dust, put [the
dust] into a drink of wine: it will cure the same.

For troubles of women, who suffer troubles in their 25
inward places, work for them into a salve a fox’s limbs
