qu Ι flygennysse 226 and smgre 1221). In one case we find

the sign ss used twice to show inversion of order: Afexe
erallendum 1219. The same sign also occurs sometimes in
the text either in black or in red, to refer to a word added
in the margin, f. i. above eyypetd 23, kz'ny and rex being
written in the margin (the latter twice), and after wrip 615,
on being written in the margin.

The glosses and minor pecularities will be found either
in the text or in the notes.

which has been explained otherwise, we may ascribe to
our ms. a West-Saxon origin. The use of u for y, already
noticed, the frequent occurrence of ea, eo, ἔα, eo due to
breaking (cf. Phonetics), the no less frequent occurrence of
ὢ (cf. ibid.) the monophthongization of ea into e in gellen
142⁷, gellam 228 and scellam 2212, of &a into ὁ 111 seed 22112
are, in fact, clearly West—Saxon. However some pecularities
which are not characteristic of WS. but which cannot be
considered as belonging exclusively to other dialects make
the borderland between the West-Saxon (WS.) and Anglian
(A.)-or Kentish (K.)—territories a more probable place

of origin.
