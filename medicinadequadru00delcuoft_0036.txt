XXXII INTRonuc'rmN.

C. Aecidence.
Ι. Substantives.

Observations.

1⁰. A well-known peculiarity of ME. is to be noticed
here. The forms of the substantives and adjectives show
some confusion when compared to the OE. declensions.
By the side of the full inflexions‚ which are generally pre·
served, we meet not infrequently with reduced ones and
they are sometimes dropped altogether. The cases in which
a full ending is used where no such ending occurs in OE.
are rare.

2⁰. As in other e ME. mss. the distinction between the
dative and the accusative singular is particularly difficult
after the prepositions which govern both caseS‚ as wid and
mid. The one may be admitted as well as the other when
there is no difference of form between the two, viz. in the
ᾶ stems, in the i stems with an originally short root-
syllable, or in the weak declensions. However as in the

majority of cases where the distinction is possible the da-
tive is certainly used, Ι admit it wherever a clear accusa-

tive form does not occur. In one case, viz. Wiff carena
sar 7 swege 1422 l am tempted to understand the unin-
flected sar as a dative⁷ for swege cannot possibly be an
accusative.. Cf. the note.

ξ) 38. ο stems.

[Here and in the following ἓξ (38—44) it has been
thought useless to separate, when necessary, the nouns
with originally long from those with originally short root-
syllable otherwise than by the sign ;].

1⁰. Masculine nouns.

Singular.—N. hagol 21⁶, gyrdels 219, wol 410, horn 8⁷.
