Pnonm-ms. XXVII

Notes.—-a) On the substitution of f for w cf. Spelling XVII.
b) The omission of w in aeffhylce 8⁶, flesan 8⁹ is an obvious mistake.

Liquids.
§ 23. z.

1⁰. OE. l is preserved: haelo 24, laececraeftef (for laece-
craeftes) 29.
20. We sometimes find ll written for l: till 4:24, walle 243.

§ 24. ν.

OE. r remains unehanged: rammes 1810, eamne 104.
Nota—On the substitution of y for r cf. Spelling p. XVII.

Nasals.
ᾖ 25. m.

1⁰. OE. m generally remains unchanged: man 217,
fremet? 421.

20. m and mm are used indifferently in the same word:
wommas 2216, womas 22ι8.

Note.—Besides the cases in which m with inflexional value is
represented by n (alcen, m’wen etc„ cf. Accidence), final η also occurs
sometimes for m. ef. spelling p. XIX.

§ 26. n.

10. ΟΕ. n remains unohanged: ‘nebbe 149, netelan 162.
It is dropped in the unaccented ending inq when imme-
diately preceded by an n: penige 84.

20. n occurs for rm in pane 610, done 2021, gemm 420.
Inversely nn occurs for n in linnenon 2ι3.

30. Inflexional n is sometimes dropped: gs. sunna 62,

mona 62, ds. wama 212 221.

Notes.—a) On a case of r for n ef. Spelling p. XVII.
b) do (for donne) 818 is probably a scribal error.
