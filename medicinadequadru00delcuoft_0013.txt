GENERAL REMARKS. IX

can only stand sor s has been replaced by laecccraeftcs. Yet,
with the exception of the sign oe which has been silently
normalized into ae wherever it occurs ¹, I have never ven-
tured to correct a word without mentioning it in its in-
correct form in the footnotes, the form substituted being
always that of ms. V, unless otherwise noted.2 Besides
those necessary substitutions, which are regularly indicated
by an asterisk‚ I have had recourse to ms. V wherever
the obscurity of ms. O made it desirable. In such cases
I have inserted the reading of ms, V within brackets in
the text (with no asterisk) and quoted that of ms. Ο in
the notes. Parentheses have been used only when a letter
was faint or had altogether disappeared from the text, f. i.
scindam) 165. Ι have allowed myself a free hand with
regard to the separation of words, often uniting what is
separated and separating what is united: thus Ι have
written wif-hz'nyun 1016 101⁷ instead of zoz'ffflnycm which is
the reading of the ms.; my principle in that respect has
been to write as two words united by a hyphen the
compounds which bear an accent upon the first element,
f. i. scil-qanye 62, heafocl-ece 102, and as one word those
in which the first element, accented or not, is merely a
prefix.³ The glosses and also the peculiarities of writing

¹ This holds good of the Introduction and the Notes except in
the case of 86 where the correction made by the scribe would be unin-
telligible without the ω. The spelling of the mS. is also mentioned in
the case of *loecedom 613 where it is not loecedon but laecedon.

² cf. p. XIII for a comparison between the ms. printed here (ms.
Ο) and ms. V printed by Cockayne in his Samon Leechdoms. My
corrections are taken from Cockayne's printed text which has been
collated with the original and Ι follow his spelling whether it agrees
with my principles οι· not. Words quoted from the ms. only in the
notes are transcribed unchanged.

³ However words in which the compound is less felt are written
as one word: thus lacedome 222 *morbeames 621.
