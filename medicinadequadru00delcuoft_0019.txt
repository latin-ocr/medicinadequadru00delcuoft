It will be noticed that there are but few differences
between V and BH. The latter texts having, as far as thoy
go, none of the omissions pointed out above, it would be
tempting to infer that while there is no necessary connection
between VBH and O, there is to say the least a possible
one between V and BH. This, however, is a mere hypo-
thesis.

With regard to the dates to which the mss. may be
ascribed, the date about 1050 given by Cockaynel for V
seems fairly correct and there is apparently no reason either
to dispute the other dates given by him2‚ viz. about the
same date for B and a little later for H. Ms. O, on the
other hand, though preserving many characteristics of OE.3‚
can safely be ascribed to about a century later. This is
supported by the following considerations:

1⁰. There are frequent cases of weakening and con-
fusion of the unaccented syllableS, cf. p. XXV1;

2⁰. OE. y, whether «fast» or «unfast»‚ is often rc-
presented by u: fot-swalma 125, blod-reme 14.ss 1411, hure
826, cnse 1613 16ι5 'ssim—also fflccm 10:÷;

3⁰. OE. ae is often preserved, but a is also frequently
substituted. The phonetics shows examples of pas, kabbe etc.;
