or Tm: MULBERRY- TREE. 7

so that he may not enj0y his sexual lusts‚ let him boil a
badger's testicles in running spring-water and in honey
and let him take it then fasting for three days; he will
soon be better. Against flux of blood, when to all men
the moon is seventeen nights old, after the setting of 5
the sun, come then to the tree which is called mulberry-
tree and take from it an apple (a berry) with thy left hand
with two fingers, that is with the thumb and the ring-
finger, a white apple, which as yet is not ruddy; then
list it up and up arise: this is useful for the upper part 10
of the body. Again put it down and lout down over it:
it is profitable for the lower part of the body. Before
then thou take this apple, say then these words: «Ι take
thee» etc.

When thou hast said these words, take the apple and 15
wind it up in a fine purple eloth, and see that this leech-
dom touch neither water nor earth. When there is need,
and the upper part of the body labours in any sore, or
any difficulties, bind [it] upon the forehead; if it is on
the lower part, bind [it] on the womb. Ad mulieris fluxum 20
let her take the comb with which she alone combs her
head (hair), with which no other person combed it
before nor ever shall comb it after. But under the mul-
berry-tree there let her comb her hair, let her gather
what is lost in the comb and hang it on an upstanding 25
twig of the mulberry·tree‚ and again after a while, when
clean, let her gather it [from the twig] and preserve it:
that shall be a leechdom for her, for the one who there
combs her head. If thou wish a woman to be cleansed
who never might be cleansed‚ work her a salve from the 30
hair and dry it somewhat and put it on her body; then
shall she be cleansed.
