1122 Medicina de quadrupedibus, απ early Middle-Enylz‘sh version,
has long been announced as one of the future publications of the
Early English Text Society (Extra Series). Having failed to get it
printed by the Society within reasonable fimits of time, Iasked
P1·os.Hoops’s permission to have it published as one of the An-
gyllstische Forschunyen. My respeetful thanks are due to him for his
ready acceptance of the proposal for which Ifeel the more indebted
as Prof. Hoops is, as Ι was informed after applying to him, pre-
paring the publication of a critical edition of the Medicina himself.
