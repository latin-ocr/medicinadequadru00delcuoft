Pnoxmms. XXXI

40. In the combination ης] we find 9: seq-any 216, hringy-
finyrum 65 eto, also σφι mency 1013 and 90: gemenyc 1411,
menyc 1617.

50. As in OE. the double sound is regularly repre-
sented by cg in fficge 426 815, ‹Jz'cgean 1217. We find 99
once before a guttural: miyya 1624.

Finally.

Only 5 occurs at the end of words: areg (for aweg)

416, drig 821, kzmig 1824. It is dropped in τιυὶ 621, huni 1213.

Note.—fire-9ate 165 (ΒΤ has firyen—ydt, firqin—ydt) seems to be
a scribal error. Other scribal errors are age for aweg 1010 and sylefaest
for sygefaest 223.

ξ 37. h.

A. Initially.

h occurs regularly, as in OE.:

1⁰ before vowels: havian 23, haelo 24, horn 87. auwfp
812 and oman 161 2013 are not exceptions as both weorfan
and hweorfan, oman and homan are recorded, but eafodece
242 deserves notice. There are, on the other hand, cases
n which h occurs without being justified: hifeles 424, hyr-
nenda 425, hermen 101⁷, hys 1218.

20. before consonante: hraegele 214, matre 105, hriny 165.
It is, however, dropped in ναόε 42 ete„ nappunye 208.

Β. Medially and finally.

1⁰. There is no special remark to be made here.
Examples are: gefeohte 222, Zielzaman 69, eahkraec 2021-
5efoh 211, δεινὴ 45.

20. h is lost in bur-yatun 414.
Nota—On ᾖ for h cf. Spelling p. XVII.
