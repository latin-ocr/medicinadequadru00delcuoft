GENERAL REMARKS. XIII

marked by a (W) sign. The few glosses, either in Latin
or in English, scattered in the margins or above the lines,
are more generally in black. Both titles and glosses are
occasionally framed in red. As to the dates to which those
various additions are to be ascribed and to the hands from
which they originate I can state nothing precise.

A few minor peculiarities are pointed out in the foot-
notes.

§ 3.—As pointed out above, a full comparison of the
text of ms. O with that given by other mss. 1165 outside
the scope of the present work.l It may be of interest,
however, to those acquainted with the Medicina as it is
printed in Cockayne’s Samon Leeclzdoozzs2, to have an idea
of the chief differences between ms. O and ms. V on the
one hand, and mss. B and H on the other.

Unlike the Her-barium, the Medicina is transcribecl in
ms, O in the same order as in the other 11155. If we leave
out of consideration 3 few 111165 and two portions of lines
which do not belong to the text³, it may be said that it
differs from ms. V in the following respects.

1⁰. It is considerably shorter‚ a number of paragraphs
which occur in V not being found in Ο. Among the more

important omissions are the following:

¹ My object being not to make critical a text of the Medicina,
but to bring out the characteristic points of its early ME. form, Ι
31151310 from including here 1116 lists of readings fron] mss. V, B and

H which I have drawn up.

² Vol. Ι, p. 326 ff. I refer the reader to the preface of that
work for particulars about 1116 Latin source and the English mss. older
than O, 35 3150 about our knowledge of the remedies, charms and
superstitions used among the ancients. I may add here that in that
preface Cockayne expressed the opinion that ms. Ο, which 116 had not
thought it fit to collate through, might some day be printed in full 35
3 contribution to the history of ‘the English language.
