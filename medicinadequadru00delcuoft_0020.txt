We perhaps see a proof of Norman inssuence in
the use of u in leudem& „0221;

(3⁰. offer, οὸὅεν (= mod. ον) the first examples of
which known to NED. appear in the Περὶ διόόιῑξεων2 and in
the OE. Chronicle under the date 1127 is very frequent in
our text. Two other examples of comparatively recent
words are before in her-before 103 of which NED. has no
example without the termination in oz before 12003 and
fort (= till) the first example of which to my knowledge
occurs in the Amorem Riwze4 (about the beginning of the
13th century).

ξ 4.—The chief points to be examined in connection
with spelling are 1⁰. the cases of confusion of letters, the
additions and omissions; ⁶20. the abbreviations3 3⁰. the ac-

cents, doss etc.

1⁰. Confusion of letter& additions and omissions.

As in the Herbarc'um, the cases of confusion of letters
are numerous; they can be divided under three heads:
a) those in which the confusion is merely graphic; b) those
which can be explained by some associatiom c) those in
which a pure scribal error has to be admitted. It need
hardly be added that several reasons may have contributed
to the confusion.

a) The confusion seems to be merely graphic, viz. to
be due to the resemblance of letters when we meet:

¹ It is true that spellings in u occur in the word even as early
as the 11th century (HES. ξ 589).

2 cf. 5. v, under a). The Περὶ διδάξεων is here dated 1200—95.

³ cf. 5. v. 31). biforr (Orm).

⁴ cf. Morris's Specimens of early Enylish IX, 311 etc. Of course
the A. R. writes τιον-ί.
