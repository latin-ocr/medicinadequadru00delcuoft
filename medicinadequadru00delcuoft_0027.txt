a compromise between the vocalism of gyrat and that of
‚qual-1622, pule 2020, fulfane 2025. The spelling
in u after w in wem-mas 812 is regular in late WS.2

20. For ΟΕ. «umfast» y cf. under ι’.

Long vowels.
§ 9. ᾱ.

ΟΕ. a is preserved whether it represents

α) Germ. ai: haban 23, aelle 41, hares 1823 etc.

Nota—On haete 106, haele 1013 etc„ haeres 202 2014 cs. Spelling
p. XVII.

β) WGerm. a: gela-cna& 1412. We meet also with
laecned 412.

ξ 10. ὦ.

ΟΕ. εξ representing ι’ mutation of Germ. ai is preserved
as ξε aem'ge 41, aenigzm 44 614, gelzaeled 410, aer 62, daele 616,
claensunye 1226. However by-forms in a are not rare:
ar 820, haled 1012, alcen 44, clane 621 and geclansod 623
show the vocalism of the adverb clane.

Notes.—a) The a in hamede 164 is somevvhat surprising as the gram—
mars and dictionaries have only 333 still as the vowel rests 011 Germ.
ai, ᾱὲ being due to the verb haeman, a by-form in ᾱ is quite admissihle.

b) ealtewa 1218 is no doubt a scribal error for ecilteaw. For examples

of ealteaw cf. BT s. v.

§11. τὲ.

OE. WS. εὑ (corresponding to A. and K. e) remains
unchanged: faetelsa 48, naerdran 82, waetan 83, gewaege 814,
oferslaepe 122, paer-to 124, paer-on 2211, blaedran 12ι5, waep-
ned 1222, eage-braewas 1614, laecedom 2011. Here again by-
forms in ᾱ occur here and there: lacedome 222, pare 622,
parmid 109 2023.
