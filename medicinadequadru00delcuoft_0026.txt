b) tofi-rima appears with the two vocalisms eo, ea: todreomera
(sor reomena) 2222, tefi (for tofi)·reaman 142. Prof. Napier suggests to
me that while the former represents an o mutation of i (Biilhr. ᾖ 235
Sc 237), the latter is to be compared to seriptedro as against te'oru (SieV.
ξ 43, 2), bearing a secondary accent. Another hypothesis proposed by
the same authority is that reaman is perhaps due to confusion with

νὲοφηα, reama z membrane.
