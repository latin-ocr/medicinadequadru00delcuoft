GENERAL REMARKS. XI

p follows t. All words are mentioned under their initials,
except compounds in ge which will be found under the
simple words. All forms, either correct or not, and all
variant spellings are entered, the starting-point‚ however,
being only the OE. form which is quoted in spaced type.¹
When there is no difference between that form and that
referred to, it is not repeated, even if the latter represents
a case or person which makes it different from the former:
thus after opt. 3d. pl. wexan (from 141) is not quoted
because wewam, being also the form of the infinitive, is
written in the margin. Contractions are expanded, and it
has been thought useless to reproduce the accents of the
text. The gender of nouns is designated except when it is
unknown to Sweet and BT3 if it is doubtful it is written
within parentheses.2 Numerals indicate the six classes of
ablaut verbs (after Sievers's classification); w. 1, w. 2, vv. 3
the three classes of weak verbs; pret—p. the preterite-present
verbs; anV. the anomalous verbs; rd. the reduplicative
verbs. The case governed by the verb 15 mentioned if it
is not the accusative. The parts of the verb are quoted
in the following order: inf„ pr. p., ger.‚ ind. pres, opt.
pres„ imp, ind. pret., opt. pret, pp„ no designation being
used in the case of ind. and of pres.3 Here again paren-
theses show that what they include has been entered with

² The entries placed within brackets refer to words not belonging
to ms. O. Those within parentheses are hypothetical forms: thus
(dhyldam fel-stycce).

² Parentheses are also used for explanatory words (cf. leoht) and
with the word Idpartus, my knowledge of which does not go beyond
the word itself.

³ This and a certain number of the other principles adopted in
the glossary are borrowed from the glossary contributed by Prof.
L. M. Harris to The yospel of St. John in WS.; cf. the list of books
referred to. One of the said principles is to add «eto» after references
wherever at least two more examples might be addueed.
