Let those who suffer apparitions eat lion’s ssesh: they
will not after that suffer any apparitions. Against sore
of sinews and of knee-joints, take a lion's suet and a
hart’s marrow, melt [them] and mingle [them] together;
smear therewith the sore of the body: it will soon be whole. 5

Against the dwelling [by one] of snakes and for their
removal, scatter a bull's horn burnt to ashes where the
snakes dwell3 they will ssee away. Mingle a bull's gall
with fieldbees' honey against obscurity and darkness os
the eyes3 put [it] upon the eyes: it cures wonderfully. 10
Against a burn caused by water or tire, burn a bull’s
dung and shed [it] thereon. Ad concubitum perficiendum,
sume testiculos tauri siccatos in pulveremque redactos, aut
eosdem in vino comminue et crebris [ille] haustibus ebibat
[qui hoc philtro indiget]: ita promptior ad vererem erit 15
atque citatior.

Against any spot, to take it from the body, take ivory
pounded with honey and applied: it removes the spots
wonderfully. Against all sores, if thou in the early part
of summer takest for food any whelp, being then still 20
blind, thou shalt not feel any sore. To make teeth
grow without pain, a hound's molar tooth burnt and
rubbed small and applied extinguishes swellings oftoothrooms.

in case he should here refer to Cockayne‘s text, by the omission of the
beginning of the sentence. It is very similar in V to what it is in O, and
Cockayne's omission must he due to a mistake. — 2⁶2 '‘gedon] ms.
